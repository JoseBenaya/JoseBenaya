# 👋 Hello, I'm Jose Alfred Benaya

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a curious **data engineer** with a love for software craftsmanship. I enjoy crafting solutions that make data practical and usable. My toolkit blends **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and **web development** — and I love learning new things along the way.

## 🚀 What I Do

🔧 **Data Engineering & Automation**  
I specialize in building robust data pipelines with tools like Airflow, Kafka, and Spark — turning raw data into usable insights.

🤖 **Applied Machine Learning**  
I’ve built ML systems using Scikit-learn and TF-IDF for use cases like recommendations and resume-matching.

🌐 **Full-Stack Apps**  
With **Svelte**, **FastAPI**, and sometimes **Django**, I bring data-driven ideas to life with clean and fast UIs.
